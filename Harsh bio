Harsh, a 12th-grade humanities student with a determined heart and an unstoppable mind, stands at the crossroads of passion, intellect, and justice. He is not just a student with big dreams, but a budding advocate for equality, a future lawyer, and a socially conscious individual who refuses to remain silent on issues that matter. From the moment he took the stage in Grade 5, he discovered that the voice behind the microphone was the most powerful tool one could wield—and it was one he vowed to never let go of.
With 15 Model United Nations (MUN) conferences, two Youth Parliaments (YP), and three debating competitions under his belt, Harsh’s experiences shaped him into a refined orator, ready to challenge oppressive systems and advocate for change, no matter how difficult the journey might seem. His love for public speaking is not merely about winning arguments; it’s about making an impact.
At the core of his beliefs lies a simple but profound idea—those who live beyond the bars of oppression have a responsibility to raise their voices for those still trapped within. He firmly believes that inequality persists because the privileged often remain silent, and for him, silence is not an option. Inspired by the powerful words of author and activist Arundhati Roy, he holds dear one of her most iconic quotes: “There is no such thing as an innocent bystander. In a fire, every bystander is an arsonist.” This philosophy fuels his desire to engage in activism and law, as he sees these paths as essential in creating a society where justice and equality prevail.
He  is deeply committed to championing the rights of marginalized groups, especially those from conflict-ridden regions like Afghanistan, Syria, and Palestine. He takes a bold stance against imperialism, condemning the way powerful nations shape global politics through exploitation and oppression. He raises his voice fearlessly, standing in solidarity with those who are silenced by fundamentalist regimes or victims of international injustices.
His passion for politics is nothing short of remarkable. Unlike many, he navigates through political ideologies with curiosity, balancing his inclinations towards communism and anarchism, all while living under the paradox of capitalism. He finds this contradiction amusing, but rather than struggling with it, he embraces it as part of his complex personality—a sign of his open-mindedness and ability to see the world from multiple perspectives.
His love for regional and national politics shapes his understanding of how meaningful change must begin at the grassroots level. Harsh often argues that while global treaties and international agreements seem grand, they remain ineffective unless real change is implemented by regional entities and leaders on the ground. His belief in local action as the key to transformation stands in contrast to those who look only towards international institutions for solutions.
He is no stranger to ideological clashes—especially in his academic life. He attends a college that engages deeply with politics but holds views opposed to his own ideals, a contrast that both challenges and intrigues him. Rather than being discouraged, he views this paradox as an opportunity for intellectual growth. These disagreements ignite passionate conversations that sharpen his debating skills and strengthen his convictions. He thrives in environments where ideas are questioned, and consensus is rare—because it is through conflict that he hones the art of persuasion.
Since his childhood, he has had a natural talent for speaking. From school assemblies to public events, he has taken every opportunity to express his thoughts. His love for public speaking began when he first stood behind a podium in Grade 5, delivering a speech to his school audience. That moment sparked a passion that has only grown stronger with time. His journey from small assemblies to high-stakes MUNs and Youth Parliaments is not just a story of competition—it’s a story of personal evolution. With every speech, he refines his ability to connect with audiences, argue logically, and speak from the heart.
Through years of participation in MUNs and debates, he has developed a reputation as a persuasive orator who can present complex ideas with clarity and conviction. His experiences have not only sharpened his debating skills but also deepened his understanding of diplomacy, negotiation, and conflict resolution—skills that will serve him well in his future career as a lawyer.
Books are not just a source of knowledge for Harsh—they are companions that shape his worldview. His all-time favorite book, The God of Small Things by Arundhati Roy, occupies a special place in his heart. The book’s exploration of oppression, love, and forbidden relationships resonates deeply with Harsh’s own belief in the importance of questioning societal norms. For him, gifting this book to his friends is not just an act of generosity—it is a way of sharing the values that define him.
Roy’s fearless writing style and commitment to challenging authority inspire him to pursue a path where he, too, can question power structures and advocate for change. Much like Roy, he believes that neutrality in the face of injustice is complicity. His admiration for her work goes beyond literature—he sees it as a call to action.
His frustration with fundamentalism stems from his commitment to equality and justice. He is deeply concerned about the plight of women in war-torn regions and raises his voice against the oppression they face in countries like Afghanistan and Syria. He believes that the fight for women’s rights is not just a regional issue—it is a global cause that requires everyone’s attention. He strongly supports the Palestinian struggle for freedom, seeing it as a symbol of resistance against imperialism and oppression.
His outspokenness on these issues reflects his belief that real change requires challenging the narratives promoted by the West. For him, speaking out against injustice—whether it is political, economic, or social—is not just a choice but a responsibility.
His dream of becoming a lawyer is not driven by ambition alone—it is fueled by his desire to be a voice for those who cannot speak for themselves. He sees law as more than just a profession; it is a tool to dismantle oppressive systems and create a society where everyone, regardless of their background, has equal access to justice.
With his extensive experience in debates and public speaking, He  is well-prepared to step into the legal world. His ability to understand complex issues, argue persuasively, and remain calm under pressure will serve him well as he navigates the challenges of law school and beyond. For him, becoming a lawyer is not just about building a career—it is about building a better world.
